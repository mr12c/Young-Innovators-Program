                  <p>I accompanied Manveer Singh and Parineeti Bhura of our school to YIP. The team was awarded the first prize for their project on the anti-pollution mask that is herbal, homemade, and reusable. IIT Kharagpur always motivates students to do something good and new for the welfare of society and our environment. The hospitality and arrangement for the participants were perfect. The event was all about teamwork. We are really thankful to the organizers for changing the way of thinking and developing a scientific attitude in our students. Thank you for becoming our inspiration!

                    We are a project-based school and work on real-time problems which the children see at home or school or the neighborhood and try to devise sustainable solutions. For us, we need platforms like this where kids can showcase their work. I like the way the students of IIT Kharagpur have taken up the responsibility for organizing and conducting this program.
